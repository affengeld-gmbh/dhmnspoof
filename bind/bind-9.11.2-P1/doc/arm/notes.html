<a name="root_key"></a>New DNSSEC Root Key</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      ICANN is in the process of introducing a new Key Signing Key (KSK) for
      the global root zone. BIND has multiple methods for managing DNSSEC
      trust anchors, with somewhat different behaviors. If the root
      key is configured using the <span class="command"><strong>managed-keys</strong></span>
      statement, or if the pre-configured root key is enabled by using
      <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-validation auto</strong></span>, then BIND can keep keys up
      to date automatically. Servers configured in this way should have
      begun the process of rolling to the new key when it was published in
      the root zone in July 2017. However, keys configured using the
      <span class="command"><strong>trusted-keys</strong></span> statement are not automatically
      maintained. If your server is performing DNSSEC validation and is
      configured using <span class="command"><strong>trusted-keys</strong></span>, you are advised to
      change your configuration before the root zone begins signing with
      the new KSK. This is currently scheduled for October 11, 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      This release includes an updated version of the
      <code class="filename">bind.keys</code> file containing the new root
      key. This file can also be downloaded from
      <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/bind-keys" target="_top">

<a name="relnotes_license"></a>License Change</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/" target="_top">

    <p>
      As of BIND 9.11.2, Windows XP is no longer a supported platform for
      BIND, and Windows XP binaries are no longer available for download
      from ISC.
